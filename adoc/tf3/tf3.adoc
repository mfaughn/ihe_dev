== Introduction

This document, Volume 3 of the IHE Devices (DEV) Technical Framework, defines content modules used in the IHE Devices profiles.

=== Introduction to IHE

Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) is an international initiative to promote the use of standards to achieve interoperability among health information technology (HIT) systems and effective use of electronic health records (EHRs). IHE provides a forum for care providers, HIT experts and other stakeholders in several clinical and operational domains to reach consensus on standards-based solutions to critical interoperability issues.

The primary output of IHE is system implementation guides, called IHE Profiles. IHE publishes each profile through a well-defined process of public review and trial implementation and gathers profiles that have reached final text status into an IHE Technical Framework, of which this volume is a part.

For more general information regarding IHE, refer to http://www.ihe.net[www.ihe.net]. It is strongly recommended that, prior to reading this volume, the reader familiarizes themselves with the concepts defined in the https://profiles.ihe.net/GeneralIntro/index.html[IHE Technical Frameworks General Introduction].

=== Intended Audience

The intended audience audience of IHE Technical Frameworks Volume 3 is:

* IT departments of healthcare institutions
* Technical staff of vendors participating in the IHE initiative
* Experts involved in standards development

=== Overview of Technical Framework Volume 3

The remainder of Section 1 further describes the general nature, purpose and function of the Technical Framework. Section 2 presents the conventions used in this volume to define IHE transactions.

Section 3 defines the general approach for defining device-related content. Subsequent sections address general content elements, as well as specifications for the content related to specific integration profiles and device specializations (e.g., ventilator). All of these address both terminology and information model specifications. These abstract semantic content specifications may then be bound to IHE profile implementations, including the “payload” in transactions, as well as content modules in documents. In some cases this content may be mandatory for a given exchange, and in others it may be used as the result of a profile option.

The appendices following the main body of this volume provide technical details associated with the semantic content specifications.

== Overview of device semantic content profiling 

Though the transactions and messages defined in TF-2 provide for syntactic interoperability, in order to achieve semantic interoperability, each class of device must use the same terminology and data organization or modeling for common information. This TF-3 defines common abstract semantics or content profiles for patient care devices that fall within this domain. The semantics are based on the ISO/IEEE 11073-10101 nomenclature/terminology and the ISO/IEEE 11073-10201 domain information model, with additional semantics systems specified as appropriate (e.g., LOINC or SNOMED-CT), either as mappings to ISO/IEEE concepts or independently for non-mappable concepts. Other sections of the Devices Technical Framework define the mapping of these semantics to the information technologies defined for each transaction (for example, the TF-2 (Appendix A) _Mapping ISO/IEEE 11073 Domain Information Model to HL7_).

*_Note that this content specification is not intended to be exhaustive – the referenced standards should be consulted for more complete information._*

In general, if a concept is not specified in this volume nor in the base standards (e.g., IEEE 11073-10101), a request should be made to the appropriate standards development organization (“SDOs”) to consider the additional concepts. Typically, this may be accomplished without significant delays, and if necessary, temporary term codes provided. See discussions below for additional information.

===  General device content considerations

This section addresses those issues that are transitive across all device types. Subsequent sections integrate these considerations as applicable to specific device specializations.

==== Hierarchical containment tree information

Each data item associated with a device specialization is specified within the context of its “containment tree” – all parameters are formalized either as attributes of a given object, or as instances of data objects that are contained within other objects in accordance to the following basic hierarchyfootnote:[See ISO/IEEE 11073-10201 Domain Information Model for complete details on these and other objects.]:

image:extracted-media-tf3/media/image2.emf[extracted-media-tf3/media/image2]

Figure 3.1.1-1: Basic ISO/IEEE 11073 Containment Tree

There are many additional objects defined in the ISO/IEEE 11073 information model (e.g., waveform and alarm / alert monitoring objects); however, for the purposes of this technical framework, only the above objects are utilized. Each object provides the following:

____
*Medical Device System* Top level object that establishes the overall context for all device data. In addition to a basic device name (e.g., Ventilator), this object includes attributes for a unique identifier (e.g., EUI-64), manufacturer and model, subcomponent serial numbers, device date and time, A/C power status, battery charge level, locale, etc. Note that an MDS may contain additional MDS objects. This would be the case when, for example, a physiological monitor integrates additional devices such as external infusion pumps and ventilators.footnote:[Not shown here are the 4 MDS specializations: Simple MDS (contains a single VMD instance), Hydra MDS (contains multiple VMD instances); Composite Single Bed MDS (contains embedded MDSs for a single patient); and Composite Multi Bed MDS (multiple MDSs for multiple patients), identified in the ISO/IEEE 11073-10201 standard. None of these specialization objects add any attribution – they only reflect the relationships between the MDS and other objects (namely, other MDSs, VMDs, and Patient Demographics).]

*Virtual Medical Device* Supports a particular device specialization that may contain multiple channels and reflects a basic device building block. For example, an airway VMD may contain channels for pressure, flow, volume, and breath metrics. For devices with plug-in modules, each component is typically formalized by a VMD instance.

*Channel* Provides for the aggregation of closely related data objects. For example, an infusion pump VMD may contain multiple fluid source channels, each with its own parameters for delivery rate, volume to be infused (“VTBI”), volume infused, drug label, etc.

*Metric* This abstract class (it is only inherited by the specialization objects and may not be instantiated alone) provides a basic set of attributes for all the specialization objects. For example, status (e.g., available, disabled, etc.), body site list, measurement start/stop time, label, etc.

*Numeric* Supports values that are represented as a numeric quantity (e.g., a set breath rate). Attributes include value, units, time stamp, ranges, resolution, etc. Compound values are supported where multiple values are realized in a single numeric (e.g., diastolic and systolic blood pressure is typically represented as a compound numeric value).

*Enumeration* Supports parameters that are typically represented by a set of specified values. For example, a device’s operational mode may be represented by one of a finite set (e.g., for a ventilator the mode may be CPAP, SIMV, assist, etc.).
____

Though the sequential ordering of objects and attributes are typically not important (e.g., information from multiple VMDs in an MDS may be communicated in any order), the containment associations must be maintained. For example, multiple channels may have the same “infusion rate” parameter – if they are not properly associated to the right channel, then the information will not be correctly interpreted. Additionally, containment is strictly enforced (e.g., an Enumeration instance may not be contained directly under a VMD or MDS without a Channel).

For each of the device specializations specified below, the containment tree associated with each device and parameter is specified sufficiently to ensure proper communication when the information is exchanged in a transaction (MDS VMD Channel Parameter); however, for some devices, though the containment relationships are fully specified, they may not be necessary (save the top level MDS that identifies the device source) – there is a single instance of the parameter for the entire device. In these cases, the actual information communicated by a given transaction may be limited to the individual parameters grouped together within a single medical device system containment.

==== Device semantics & controlled terminologies

Specific device semantics are formalized as a combination of terminology / vocabulary codes organized according to a common information model. The containment tree discussion above presented the basic ISO/IEEE 11073 information model used to organize and associate various device parameters. Terminologies are required, though, to represent each concept that is communicated. For example, an infusion rate may be communicated as “100 mL/Hr”. At least two terms are required, one for the parameter name (“infusion rate”) and one for the units of measurement (“mL/Hr”). In the device specialization sections below, all of the required semantics are specified, so as to ensure that the same term set is used for a given class of device.

==== Overview of the ISO/IEEE 11073 nomenclature/terminology

The ISO/IEEE 11073-10101 (and related) nomenclature is optimized for medical device (esp. acute care) semantics, containing an extensive set of term codes supporting the information model, device parameters, units of measurement, body sites, alert events, etc. Each term in this system is formalized as a text-based Reference Identifier and a 16-bit or 32-bit numeric code. The 16-bit code is “context sensitive” in that it may be used when you know the class of information that it represents. For example, if in a message a field is being processed that represents Units of Measurement, then the 16-bit numeric code may be used, given that the semantic context has been established. The 32-bit code is “context free” in that it is guaranteed to be unique across the entire terminology.

All text-based Reference ID’s are formalized as a contiguous string of either capitalized letters or underscores (“_”). For example, MDC_RESP_RATE or MDC_PULS_RATE. Note that the prefix “MDC” stands for medical device communication, and is often used to identify this nomenclature (e.g., “MDC” is used in HL7 to identify terms from this standard).

By convention, this Technical Framework will specify 11073 terms using the following format:

<Ref ID> (<partitionfootnote:[Note: Partition numbers are defined in ISO/IEEE 11073-10101, Section B.1.2, or in ISO/IEEE 11073-10201, type _NomPartition_ definition.] or code block>::<16-bit term code>)

For example, the two terms above would be specified as follows:

MDC_RESP_RATE (2::20490)

MDC_PULS_RATE (2::18442)

To determine the 32-bit value: <partition> * 2^16 + <16-bit term code>. So the pulse rate code above would have a 32-bit representation of 18444 (or hex 0x0002480A). The mapping rules for a given transaction technology shall indicate whether the textual Reference ID, 32-bit, or 16-bit codes may be used and how to properly encoded the terms (e.g., whether the numeric codes are formatted as text or binary values).

If additional or alternative terms are needed from other systems, such as LOINC or SNOMED-CT, they will be specified as well.

==== Private terms and scope

Some devices communicate concepts that are either not standardized (in any terminology system) or are private and should only be recognized by applications that are aware of this device’s specific semantics. In this case, the 11073 terminology provides for “private” sections of the terminology where manufacturers may define these semantics without worry of overlapping other terms already assigned. The 16-bit range from 0xF000 to 0xFFFF (hex) for each code block is reserved for private terms. If an entire private block of terms (65536 items) is required, the partition 1024 may be used.

In complex environments, though, where multiple devices are connected to a single patient and where two or more vendors may define terms with the same private codes (i.e., even the 32-bit identifier may not be unique), it is necessary to ensure proper scoping of these terms to ensure there are no collisions. To accomplish this, the scope associated with any private codes is defined by the containing VMD. This allows for modular systems where different plug-in components may be from different manufacturers.

==== New or non-specified terms

Additional terminology not contained in the device specializations below may:

* Exist in a terminology and simply hasn’t been included in this version of the Framework, *or*
* Be a new concept that should be standardized (e.g., resulting from a new device modality),
+
*or*
* Is a private or custom term that is particular to a single manufacturer’s device and should not necessarily be standardized.

In the first case, change requests may be submitted to this Technical Framework to have the needed semantics added. In general, if the semantics exist (either as terms and/or attributes in the Domain Information Model, they may be used in transactions without being added to this content specification; however, in order to achieve semantic interoperability and heterogeneity with a class of device, there must be agreement regarding the way a given concept is represented.

In the second case, new terms may be submitted to the relevant standard group for consideration. For these, either a pre-assigned term may be used or a private term until standardization is complete.footnote:[Note: The ISO/IEEE 11073 group has indicated that it will make a best effort to address all new term requests as quickly as possible and where appropriate to provide rapid assignment of Reference IDs and term codes.]

In the third case, a private code should be used and is out-of-scope for inclusion in this content specification.

==== Episodic vs. periodic data updates

Device information is typically reported in a manner appropriate for the given parameter and consuming application. Data reporting modes include:

* Periodically – for parameters that change or are updated regularly. For example, the volume delivered on an infusion pump changes regularly based on the fluid delivery rate.
* Periodically High-Frequency – for data that is reported periodically but at high data rates. For example, physiological waveforms.
* Episodically – for parameters that change infrequently or based on an external event. For example, an operational setting is modified by the clinician or a breath or heart beat has been detected.
* Snap-shot – for those applications that only request the current value of a device’s information at infrequent intervals. For example, once every 10 minutes or an hour.

Where appropriate, the device parameter specifications below shall indicate whether a particular item is updated periodically or episodically. In the ISO/IEEE 11073 information model, the Metric::MetricRelevance and Metric::MetricAccess provide this information.

In the ISO/IEEE 11073 information model, provision for creating data updates or “event reports” for these various methods fall to a number of “extended services” objects such as an episodic scanner, periodic scanner, or fast periodic scanner. Each instance of these objects “scans” a configured list of data items and when changes are detected, generates an update including those parameters. For example, a “breath” episodic scanner instance would report all breath-to-breath related parameters (e.g., I:E ratio, inspiratory time, peak inspiratory pressure, etc.) whenever a breath completion has been detected.

Depending on the transaction profile conveying the device data, identification of these update classes may be supported. If so, the following terms should be used to differentiate the update type being reported:

==== Alternative units of measurement mapping

Though the basic units of measurement specified in this technical framework are from the ISO/IEEE 11073-10101 Units of Measurement partition, mappings to alternative terminology systems may be required for some implementations of this technical framework. For each parameter in the device specializations that includes a unit of measurement specification, the ISO/IEEE term is called out. The following table provides a summary of all the units of measurement terms utilized by this framework and provides for their mapping to alternative systems

=== Alert and event semantics

Most medical devices provide indications of event or alert conditions. These are typically technical (e.g., a sensor needs to be calibrated or has been detached from the device), or physiological (e.g., a patient’s spontaneous breath rate is too high). There is also a prioritization associated with alert conditions (low, medium and high), and each device specifies the prioritization within a given class (e.g., if a device has 10 high priority alerts, and three are active, which is the highest priority of the three?).

Additionally, an alert condition may be associated with the entire device (e.g., low battery), a particular channel (e.g., occlusion on infusion channel #2), or a specific parameter (e.g., heart rate too high). When communicated, the alert conditions should be associated with the appropriate device scope or entity within the device’s information containment tree or hierarchy. When associated with a given parameter (e.g., a monitored temperature or pressure reading), generic event codes are preferred over more specific terms. For example, “low” or “high” or “irregular” as associated with a monitored heart rate parameter vs.” high beat rate” and “low beat rate”, etc. In most cases, though, specific codes must be used, such as “gas contaminated” or “asystole”.

Though some of these semantics are particular to a specific device, most are general and may be applied to multiple devices. The following table provides examples of common alert semantics that may be used in this TFfootnote:[For a more complete listing of device alert semantics, see ISO/IEEE 11073-10101 Section A.9 _Nomenclature, data dictionary, and codes for alerts (Block E)_, or Annex B.4 in the same standard.]:

Note: Private event codes may be used to define non-standardized events that are not contained in the table above or in the base ISO/IEEE 11073-10101 standard. Any use of private event codes should be clearly described in the device’s documentation.

=== Body site semantics

One or more body sites may be associated with a given device parameter. For example, a temperature may have the same term codes, but are differentiated by the location of the where the temperature is taken. Other parameters (especially EEG and BIS measurements) are derived from signals from multiple sites. The ISO/IEEE 11073 Metric object includes an attribute listing body sites, either from the base 11073-10101 terminology or from other vocabularies. The following table provides some examples of body sites that may be associated with a device parameter:

=== VMD semantics

Each MDS contains one or more Virtual Medical Devices (VMD). As stated above, a VMD may be used to represent either a major functional unit within a device (e.g., a ventilator may have one VMD to contain settings and general operational parameters and another as an Airway monitor or Airway Gas Analyzer). Additionally, VMDs typically represent units that may be plugged into other devices such as physiological monitors. The attributes in the following table apply to all VMD instances in the device specializations defined below:

Table 3.6-1: Virtual Medical Device (VMD) Attributes

[width="100%",cols="13%,19%,29%,14%,25%",options="header",]
|===

|Locale |Structure defining the device’s country, language and character setting. |MDC_ATTR_LOCALE (1::2600) |Locale |Same as MDS above.
|===

=== Channel semantics

Channels provide aggregation for closely related parameters. For devices that contain “channels” (e.g., ECG channels or infusion pump fluid channels), these definitions provide a means for differentiating parameters with identical term codes (e.g., fluid source channel rate or volume infused) but contained in different channels. The attributes in the following table apply to all Channel instances in the device specializations defined below:

=== Device: Infusion Pump

*Editor’s Note*: This section will be updated with the content from the Device Specialization – Infusion Pump Profile that is currently under development.

==== Containment tree

Infusion pumps organize their information as follows:

Table 7.1.1-1: Infusion Pump Containment Tree

[width="100%",cols="17%,15%,18%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Infusion Pump Containment Tree | | |

| | |Channel: Delivery |MDC_DEV_PUMP_INFUS_CHAN_DELIVERY (1::61442)
|===

For devices that support a secondary or “piggy-back” channel, two Source channels should be defined, one as the primary channel, and one as the secondary. In other words, source channels are defined for each fluid that is routed to a given delivery or distal path. An infusor VMD shall have one and only one delivery channel. Devices that contain multiple delivery channels shall define multiple infusor VMD instances.

=== Device: Ventilator

*Editor’s Note*: This section will be updated with the results of the on-going ventilator working group efforts (in conjunction with ISO TC121 and ISO/IEEE 11073); this effort should also ultimately result in a Device Specialization – Ventilator Integration Profile that will then totally replace the content in this section. The information that is currently here tracks the results of the IEEE 11073 ventilator specialization group that was working on the ISO/IEEE 11073-10303 standard.

=== Device: Physiologic Monitor

*Editor’s Note*: The information that is in this section tracks the results of the IEEE 11073 physiological monitor specialization group that was working on the ISO/IEEE 11073-10302 standard. It is anticipated that ultimately, this section shall be replaced by a Device Specialization – Physiological Monitor Integration Profile. Note that many of the Channel sections below contain empty tables. The content is exactly as it has been published previously within the DEV TF-2 Appendix D. The original intent was to add exemplar parameters into these tables; however, that activity was never undertaken. It could be the subject of a fairly simple CP to TF-3 though.
